Couple of exercises about linked lists:

1) Implement a linked list (singly) with required methods:
   - addFirst
   - addLast
   - removeFirst
   - removeLast
   - contains
   - size
   - indexOf

   Solution: ../Implementation/linkedList.js

2) Reverse a Linked List in place.
   Solution: reverse method in ../Implementation/linkedList.js

3) Implement a doubly linked list.
4) Implement a circular linked list.

5) Finde the nth node from the end in one pass.
   Hint: Use two pointers, and keep a distance equals to n - 1 between them.
   Solution: getNthFromEnd method in ../Implementation/linkedList.js

6) Find the middle of a linked list in one pass.
7) Check to see if a linked list has a loop.
